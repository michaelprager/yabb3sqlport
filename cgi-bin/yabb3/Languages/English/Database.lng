'3' => 'Return to FILE Database',
'4' => 'or change the Database access information:',
'5' => 'If you want you can delete the Members/<i>username</i>.vars and Messages/<i>threadnumber</i>.ctb files now. They are not needed any more, now that you are on MySQL-DB.',
'6' => 'Delete unused files',
'9' => 'First we need this informations:',
'10' => 'Yes, I am allready runing tables with member informations (also if only in parts) from where we can get some or all data needed by YaBB.<br />If you leave this unchecked we will build compleatly new tables.',
'11' => 'OK, you have some data in your existing tables.<br />We can use external data to build the <i>username</i>.vars and the log.txt information for YaBB.<br />Tell us in which table to use and under which colum name we can find this data. If you leave one free, we will build this colum in a separate table.',

If this is done, the conversion can be started on next page.<br /><b>ATENTION:</b> If you have tables in your database with the same names as this we will build now (YaBB-Prefix_vars, YaBB-Prefix_ctb, ...) then they will be <u>removed</u> together with all data in it, before we build the new tables!!! Tables with other names will not be touched.',

In this case the page will be refreshed to avoid server timeout. No files will be deleted in this process. You can do this later.<br /><br /><br />ATTENTION: If some data in your <i>username</i>.vars files is longer then 510 characters (ex.: regreason, signature, addgroups, board_notifications, thread_notifications, favorites, buddylist, awayreply), the rest will be cut and is lost for Database usage!<br />The same happens if the \'repiers\' of the .ctb files become larger then 510 characters.',

The yabbusername can be equal your displayname ("realname") but must not. In any case this name is not visibel for other YaBB users and can not be changed. If we don\'t find a username in your table maching the YaBB username, we will add it to your table with all the values in the <i>username</i>.vars file. If we find a row with the username in your tabel, we will ignore the values in the .vars-file and use the values of the table even if there are no values in it! In both case only the values without colum in your table will be overtaken into a new build table.',
'password' => 'Use your passwords only if they are encrypted in the exact same way as they are by YaBB, or modify the YaBB code in the following place to match your password structure: Subs.pl =&gt; sub encode_password {<br />Do this only if you know exactly what you are doing!!! The password in this table is also transmitted and stored in the cookies. So never let them unencrypted!!!',
'username' => 'The values in this colum must be the same as in \'yabbusername\' from above!!! The only difference is that the rows will be added and removed dynamically, depending on when the user goes Online and when he goes Off again or the "Time while a usere is shown as Online" is over.',


'100' => 'All <i>username</i>.vars and <i>threadnumber</i>.ctb filed have been converted into the MySQL database.<br />If you want to free up some space on your account, you can now (or later) delete all this converted files.',
'101' => 'All <i>users</i> and <i>ctb</i> infos have been converted back into files.<br />If you want to free up some space on your account, you can now (or later) delete the MySQL tables used by YaBB. We don\'t provide a function for this, so you must use your MySQL program and do it yourself.',
